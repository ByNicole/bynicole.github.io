I'm so stressed I could barf, most of the time.  Here is my account of life. Please come back from time to time to get raw opinions on what is like to live life as a women, who just wants to love others, and make a living while trying to be a great wife and ok mom and an alright friend.
I am trying to be more better with writing.  I plan to write new stuff, I plan to transcribe my old stuff so it is all in a digital format, and will be writing opinions of my old stuff as well.  Pictures and articles and randomness.  Please know that when I write it is my creative outlet and my emotional experience.  As this is the case I do not always punctuate and capitalize as when i write formally.  Please do not judge as this is who I am and if you don't like it.....stop reading.  READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.
