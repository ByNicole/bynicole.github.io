Why is life so hard sometimes?  Not having the answers for your self or others you care about.  Sometimes sitting on the comfy couch with an afgan blanket is the coziest and most comforting feeling you can get.  No words from your partner help. You just sit there sad.

What is your outlet?  I don't really have one right now.  I used to write all of the time.  I used to write every single day with out fail.  I would love to get into that habit again.  Life is just so crazy, would I even make it to the desk to grab a pen? Sometimes it takes me 20 minutes to walk from the kitchen to the office because of questions from the kids or forgetting what i'm trying to do all together.  I guess my point here is that I want writing to be my outlet again.  It is a skill that I have to start practicing.
