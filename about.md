The Peace Center provides a platform for churches and individuals to network and share ideas, people, money, studies, and space. This cross-denominational perspective helps churches connect to their surrounding christian church community as they share best practices, ideas for fundraising, volunteers, and resources.


## Benefits of LoveBridge

Examples of what bridging the christian community looks like:

- Public Calendar of Bible Studies in Ypsilanti
- Defining spiritual gifts 
- Serving our beloved Ypsilanti regardless of religious affiliation.
