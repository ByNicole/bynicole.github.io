This cross-denominational perspective helps connect our christian church communities as they share best practices, ideas for fundraising, volunteers, and resources. We hope to help churches and organizations to share ideas, people, money, studies, and space.

## Examples of what bridging the christian community looks like:

- Public Calendar of Bible Studies in Ypsilanti
- Defining spiritual gifts 
- Serving our beloved Ypsilanti regardless of religious affiliation. 
- Linking organizations, churches & people to create meaningful relationships
- Startup ministries assistance
- A non-affiliated meeting place for networking, counseling & etc.
- Requests for christian communion regardless of denomination
