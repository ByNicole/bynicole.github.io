I worked with Beacon Management which is a daughter company of The Lightstone Group.  I worked at Spice Tree for 13 months.  In this time frame I was the Assistant Manager but for most of the time I was the acting Manager due staffing changes.  At the time of acting manager the leasing manager and service manager had also left do to a new position at another company and / or promotions within the company.  l struggled through the spring and beginning of summer rush on my own and had gotten very behind due to the high volume of traffic.  Help was sent and I was able to get caught up in the middle of summer, but at that point there were other issues upon issues that would come out of the wood work due to lack of knowledge and willingness to work from old employees making my job incredibly difficult. We had finally hired a really great new manager and we were all excited to become an all star team again. I struggled the last of the summer and could catch a break for the life of me.  I wasn't able to give good customer service to anyone and it was killing me.  I literally wanted to vanish because of how awful I felt about it and how the residents made me about myself.  I have never been yelled and disrespected so much in my entire life as I had been working at Spice Tree.  I respected the manager and regional manager that i was working under a ton so I made sure to give a long resignation  window of a 6 weeks.  I really wanted to leave SpiceTree the best way possible with out pissing any one else off and hopefully leaving them in better hands than they were with me.
