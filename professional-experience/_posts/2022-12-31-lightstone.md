I worked with Beacon Management which is a daughter property of The Lightstone Group.  I worked at Spice Tree for 13 months.  In this time frame I was the Assistant Manager but for most of the time I was the acting Manager due staffing changes.  At the time of acting manager the leasing manager and service manager had also left do to a new position at another company and / or promotions within the company.  l struggled through the spring and beginning of summer rush on my own and was getting very behind.  Help was sent and caught me up in the middle of summer but at that point there were issue upon issue that would come up due to lack of knowledge and willingness to work from old employees making my job incredibly difficult even after we had hired a really great new manager. I struggled the last of the summer and could catch a break for the life of me.  I wasn't able to give good customer service to anyone and it was killing me.  I literally wanted to vanish because of how awful I felt about it and how the residents made me about it.  I respected the manager and regional manager that i was working under a ton so I made sure to give a long resignation  window of a 6 weeks.  I really wanted to leave SpiceTree the best way possible with out pissing any one else off and hopefully leaving them in better hands than they were with me.
