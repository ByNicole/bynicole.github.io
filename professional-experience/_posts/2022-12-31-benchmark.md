#### Benchmark

In 2016 I was hired by The Benchmark Group at Fairway Trails.  I started as a part-time leasing consultant.  I had never been in property management before in my life.  The closest I had come was when I  worked in real estate in my 20's and 30's.  I quickly became enthralled with my new job and couldn't get enough.  I became full time and not long after that became the Assistant manager.  Duties I had at Fairway Trails were as such:
