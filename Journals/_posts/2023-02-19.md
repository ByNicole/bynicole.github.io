> I am really grumpy and I just don't feel like talking with many people.  Steve is on the small group zoom call and they are all talking about the prayers that they need.  we just changed the office and vinnie's room. I like the new location. They are all very nice, caring people and i feel bad because i am just sitting in the background.  I am listening though and being respectful. I am trying to be more better with writing.  I plan to write new stuff, I plan to transcribe my old stuff so it is all in a digital format, and will be writing opinions of my old stuff as well.  Pictures and articles and randomness.  Please know that when I write it is my creative outlet and my emotional experience.  As this is the case I do not always punctuate and capitalize as when i write formally.  Please do not judge as this is who I am and if you don't like it.....stop reading.
