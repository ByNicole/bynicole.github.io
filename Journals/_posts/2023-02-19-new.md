I am really grumpy and I just don't feel like talking with many people.  Steve is on the small group zoom call and they are all talking about the prayers that they need.  we just changed the office and vinnie's room. I like the new location. They are all very nice, caring people and i feel bad because i am just sitting in the background.  I am listening though and being respectful.
