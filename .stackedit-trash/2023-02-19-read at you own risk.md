I am trying to be more better with writing.  I plan to write new stuff, I plan to transcribe my old stuff so it is all in a digital format, and will be writing opinions of my old stuff as well.  Pictures and articles and randomness.  Please know that when I write it is my creative outlet and my emotional experience.  As this is the case I do not always punctuate and capitalize as when i write formally.  Please do not judge as this is who I am and if you don't like it.....stop reading.  READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.
